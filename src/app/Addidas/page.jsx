        <p className="mb-4">
          Adidas has a rich history in the world of sneakers, dating back to the
          early 20th century when it was founded by Adolf Dassler in Germany in
          1924. Initially named "Gebr√ºder Dassler Schuhfabrik" (Dassler Brothers
          Shoe Factory), the company focused on producing athletic footwear.

        <p className="mb-4">
          In the 1950s, Adidas made significant strides in the sneaker industry
          by introducing innovative designs and technologies. One of its most
          iconic creations, the Adidas Samba, was launched in 1950 as a soccer
          training shoe and has since become a timeless classic in streetwear
          culture.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Throughout the years, Adidas continued to innovate, releasing
          groundbreaking models such as the Adidas Superstar in 1969, which
          became one of the best-selling sneakers of all time. The 1970s and
          1980s marked a period of expansion for Adidas as it ventured into
          other sports and collaborations, solidifying its status as a leading
          athletic footwear brand.

        <p className="mb-4">
          In the 21st century, Adidas has remained at the forefront of sneaker
          culture, collaborating with celebrities, designers, and artists to
          create limited-edition releases that capture the attention of
          sneakerheads worldwide. From the iconic Stan Smith to the cutting-edge
          UltraBoost, Adidas sneakers continue to blend style and performance,
          making them a staple in both sports and fashion.
