        <p className="mb-4">
          Puma has a storied history in the world of sneakers, tracing its roots
          back to the 20th century when it was established by Rudolf Dassler in
          Germany in 1948. Originally known as "Ruda" and later renamed Puma,
          the company initially focused on producing athletic footwear.

        <p className="mb-4">
          In the 1950s, Puma gained prominence with the release of innovative
          designs such as the Puma Atom, a lightweight track shoe that became
          popular among athletes. The brand continued to expand its offerings,
          introducing soccer cleats and other sports footwear.

          Throughout the decades, Puma cemented its status as a key player in
          the sneaker industry with iconic releases like the Puma Suede,
          launched in 1968. This classic sneaker, known for its suede upper and
          distinctive Formstrip, became a symbol of street style and urban
          culture.

        <p className="mb-4">
          In more recent years, Puma has revitalized its brand image through
          collaborations with fashion designers, artists, and celebrities.
          Notable partnerships, such as with Rihanna for the Fenty Puma
          collection, have helped Puma reach new audiences and stay relevant in
          a competitive market.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Today, Puma continues to innovate and push boundaries with its sneaker
          designs, incorporating cutting-edge technologies and sustainable
          materials. From classic silhouettes to modern performance models, Puma
          sneakers remain a favorite choice for athletes, fashion enthusiasts,
          and sneaker collectors worldwide.
